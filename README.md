Galah _(/ɡəˈlɑː/ - sounds like guh·laa)_ is a web honeypot tool powered by LLM (Large Language Models) and, for now, supports the OpenAI API. Named after the smart Australian parrot with the ability to mimic, Galah does something similar—providing interesting yet sometimes foolish responses to incoming HTTP requests. By the way, in Aussie English, [Galah](https://www.macquariedictionary.com.au/blog/article/728/) also means fool!

Unlike the traditional, cumbersome method of emulating numerous web applications with inherent limitations, Galah takes a different route. Leveraging LLMs, it processes incoming HTTP requests and dynamically crafts realistic responses on the fly to engage attackers.

> **Note:** This was a fun weekend project I created in early 2023 and is not intended for production use. The honeypot can be easily fingerprinted based on its response time, non-standard, and sometimes silly responses, or other techniques. Use this tool at your own risk, and be sure to set usage limits for your OpenAI API. The code has not been peer-reviewed, and I would appreciate any feedback and pull requests.

## Getting Started

- Ensure you have Go version 1.20+ installed.
- Create an OpenAI API key from [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
- If you want to serve over HTTPS, generate TLS certificates.
- Clone the repo and install the dependencies.
- Update the `config.yaml` file. Feel free to change the prompt too.
- Build and run the Go binary!

```
% git clone git@github.com:0x4D31/galah.git
% cd galah
% go mod download
% go build  
% ./galah -i en0 -v

## Example Responses

Stay tuned for a blog post on the analysis of data collected from a 3-month deployment of Galah on GCP. But for now, here are some local tests.

### Example 1
```
% curl http://localhost:8080/login.php
<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>Login Page</title></head><body><form action='/submit.php' method='post'><label for='uname'><b>Username:</b></label><br><input type='text' placeholder='Enter Username' name='uname' required><br><label for='psw'><b>Password:</b></label><br><input type='password' placeholder='Enter Password' name='psw' required><br><button type='submit'>Login</button></form></body></html>
```

Okay, that was nice; I'm impressed!

You're a galah, mate!
